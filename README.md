This was for a bonus-point assignment.<br>
One day in class, my professor told students that he would give bonus points to anyone who come up with a sorting algorithm idea.<br>
Why not try? My friends and I decided to work on this assignment.<br>
And this repository is about my sorting algorithm, called **even-and-odd sort**. (Sadly, later I found out that there exists this kind of algorithm named odd-even sort.)

In this algorithm, the program separates the input array to two arrays: odd number array and even number array.<br>
Numbers in each arrays will be sorted. Then, numbers will be put in the result array orderly by comparing with numbers in the opponent array.<br>
